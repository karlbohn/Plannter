Plannter is a website designed to help gardeners plan their growing season based on their climate, available space, and water availability.
Users can create an account, create garden plans tailored for different parts of the growing season, sunlight availability, and more.
Users can view data on over 3,000 plants, and add their own comments to each listing sharing their positive experiences growing the plant or the challenges they faced so that other growers can tap into that knowledge and better their own garden.

The standard flow would be:
  User creates account
  User creates & names a 'Plan'
  User searches/browses plants and adds plants to their selected plan.

Users have the option to keep their plans private, or to share them with the community.
